# Dog breed classification system

CS521 final project. Collaborators: Martin Bourbier, Jenny Hopkins, and Aigerim Dussikenova

Dataset link: `https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset`
We chose this dataset because of its comprehensiveness (over 20,000 images of 120 dog breeds). 

User passes in an image of a dog to the program and the program compares the image to the dataset and tells the user what breed of dog it is.
